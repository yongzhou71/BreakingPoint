Limitations:
Before running the sample scripts...

 - Please make sure you have proper license(s) installed on the BPS platform:
  a) for BPS HW, please make sure your unit is properly licensed with IxOS and ATI licenses;
  b) for BPS-VE, please make sure you have at least two 10G licenses activated.
  
 - Please make sure the intended ports required for the test are not reserved by other user
  a) the workaround is to add unreserve ports before reserve ports into the script to clear the existing ownership by other user.
